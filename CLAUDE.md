# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a D&D Encounter Tracker,
a Next.js 15 full-stack web application for Dungeon Masters to manage combat encounters efficiently.
The project is currently in **active development** with 46 GitHub issues created for a 12-week MVP development timeline.

### Key Features

- Initiative tracking with dexterity tiebreakers
- HP/AC management with damage and healing tracking
- Character management (PCs and NPCs) with multiclass support
- Encounter building with participant organization
- Lair actions support (unique competitive advantage)
- Freemium subscription model with 5 pricing tiers

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 with MongoDB sessions
- **Deployment:** Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library

```

### Database Schema (MongoDB)

- **Users:** Authentication, subscription tiers, preferences
- **Characters:** PCs and NPCs with full D&D 5e stats, multiclass support
- **Parties:** Character groupings with DM assignments
- **Encounters:** Combat scenarios with participants and settings
- **Combat Sessions:** Active combat state with initiative, turns, HP tracking

## Development Process

### Phase-Based Development (12 Weeks)

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Foundation (Next.js, MongoDB, UI setup)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Authentication and core components
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Character management system
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Encounter management system
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Combat system core
6. **Weeks 11-12:** Advanced features and polish

### Issue Management

- **46 MVP issues** created with detailed specifications
- Issues tagged with week assignments (Phase 1-3)
- Dependencies mapped to prevent blocking
- Follow priority system: P1>P2, Phase1>Phase2, lower#

## Key Business Context

### Subscription Tiers (Freemium Model)

- **Free Adventurer:** $0/month (1 party, 3 encounters, 10 creatures)
- **Seasoned Adventurer:** $4.99/month (3 parties, 15 encounters, 50 creatures)
- **Expert Dungeon Master:** $9.99/month (10 parties, 50 encounters, 200 creatures)
- **Master of Dungeons:** $19.99/month (25 parties, 100 encounters, 500 creatures)
- **Guild Master:** $39.99/month (Unlimited + organization features)

### Competitive Advantages

- Modern, responsive UI optimized for mobile and desktop
- Lair actions support (unique vs. competitors like Roll20, D&D Beyond)
- Superior user experience with real-time collaboration
- Optimized for D&D 5e combat mechanics

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Code Standards

- Follow Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns for consistency
- Use Mongoose for all database operations
- TDD required for all new features

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all utility functions and business logic
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user workflows
- 80%+ test coverage on touched code
