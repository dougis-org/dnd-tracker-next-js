# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a D&D Encounter Tracker - a Next.js 15 full-stack web application for Dungeon Masters to manage combat encounters efficiently. The project is currently in **active development** with 46 GitHub issues created for a 12-week MVP development timeline. **Issue #17 (UserService implementation) has been completed and merged.**

**Key Features:**

- Initiative tracking with dexterity tiebreakers
- HP/AC management with damage and healing tracking
- Character management (PCs and NPCs) with multiclass support
- Encounter building with participant organization
- Lair actions support (unique competitive advantage)
- Freemium subscription model with 5 pricing tiers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 with MongoDB sessions
- **Deployment:** Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library

```

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

This project follows a **GitHub Flow** branching strategy optimized for continuous deployment with **automated merging**:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **Feature branches** - `feature/issue-{number}-{short-description}` (e.g., `feature/issue-15-character-creation`)
- **Bugfix branches** - `bugfix/issue-{number}-{short-description}` (e.g., `bugfix/issue-23-login-validation`)
- **Hotfix branches** - `hotfix/critical-{description}` (for urgent production fixes)

### Automated Merge Policy

**PRs are automatically merged when all checks pass:**

- ✅ Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)
- ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Codacy quality gates pass
- ⏳ **120-second wait period** for checks to complete before merge decision
- 🔄 **Additional 90-second wait** if checks are still pending

### Development Workflow

1. **Start New Work**

   ```bash
   # Create and switch to new feature branch from main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/issue-{number}-{description}

   # Push branch to remote immediately
   git push -u origin feature/issue-{number}-{description}
   ```

2. **Development Process**

   ```bash
   # Upon each file change commit with descriptive messages and run a codacy scan, correcting any issues found
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add character creation form validation

   - Implement HP and AC field validation
   - Add error handling for invalid ability scores
   - Update tests for validation logic

   Relates to #15"

   # Commit and push changes for each file edited
   git push origin feature/issue-{number}-{description}
   ```

3. **Quality Checks Before PR**

   ```bash
   # Run all quality checks locally
   npm run lint              # Fix any linting issues
   npm run format           # Format code consistently
   npm run typecheck        # Ensure TypeScript compiles
   npm test                 # All tests must pass
   npm run build            # Verify production build
   use the codacy mcp server to examine the code and fix any issues it finds
   use the markdownlint-mcp server to evaluate all markdown files and fix any issues found in them
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   # Create PR using GitHub CLI (preferred)
   gh pr create --title "Add character creation form validation" \
                --body "Implements validation for character creation form as specified in #15"

   # Wait for checks to complete and handle results automatically
   sleep 120  # Wait for CI/CD checks to start and potentially complete

   # Check PR status and handle accordingly
   PR_STATUS=$(gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[].state' | sort | uniq)

   if [[ "$PR_STATUS" == "SUCCESS" ]]; then
     # All checks passed - merge automatically
     gh pr merge --auto --squash
     echo "✅ PR merged automatically - all checks passed"
   elif [[ "$PR_STATUS" =~ "PENDING" ]]; then
     # Some checks still running - wait longer
     echo "⏳ Checks still running, waiting additional 60 seconds..."
     sleep 60
     # Re-check and merge if all pass, otherwise address issues
   else
     echo "❌ Some checks failed - address issues before merging"
     gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.state != "SUCCESS")'
   fi
   ```

5. **Automated Code Review Process**
   - **Automatic Merging**: PRs are automatically merged when all checks pass
   - **Required Checks**: Build, tests, linting, TypeScript compilation, Codacy quality gates
   - **Manual Review Override**: Can be disabled for critical changes requiring human review
   - **Check Monitoring**: System waits for checks to complete before making merge decisions
   - **Failure Handling**: Failed checks must be addressed before re-attempting merge

6. **Merge and Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # After successful merge (automatic or manual), clean up locally
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/issue-{number}-{description}
   git remote prune origin
   ```

### Commit Message Standards

Follow **Conventional Commits** for consistent commit history:

```

**Required Status Checks:**

- ✅ Build successfully completes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)
- ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Codacy quality gate passes

### Pull Request Guidelines

### Emergency Procedures

**Hotfix Process:**

```bash
# For critical production issues
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-{description}
