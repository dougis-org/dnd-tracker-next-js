# Current Status - Issue #678 Remaining Test Failures Fix

## Current State
- **Branch**: `feature/issue-678-fix-remaining-test-failures`
- **Working Directory**: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- **PR**: https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/pull/689 (open, iterating with CI feedback)
- **Last Action**: Consolidated webhook test mocking helpers and identified final test issues

## Goal
Complete resolution of Issue #678 "Multiple Test Suites Failing After Clerk Migration" by fixing all remaining individual test failures. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: ALL tests must pass (`npm run test:ci` returns 0 exit code).

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED Issues
1. **Build Failure**: Fixed critical headers() TypeScript error - webhook route now awaits headers() for Next.js 15.5.2 compatibility
2. **Next.js Config Warning**: Moved `experimental.typedRoutes` to `typedRoutes` in next.config.js
3. **Build Success**: `npm run build` now passes without critical errors
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Consolidated webhook test header mocking into reusable helper functions for better maintainability

### üîÑ CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUE
**Webhook Tests Returning 500 Instead of 200**
- All webhook integration tests in `registration-integration.test.ts` are running but returning 500 status instead of expected 200
- Error indicates webhook request processing is failing despite improved mocking
- Mock setup appears correct but request/response cycle needs debugging

## Current Todo List Status

1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fix critical headers() TypeScript issue in webhook route.ts
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Update Next.js config to fix typedRoutes experimental warning  
3. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Test build to ensure fixes work
4. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Run full test suite to identify remaining failures after build fix
5. üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Fix webhook test mocking issues in registration-integration.test.ts
6. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Address remaining test failures systematically (after webhook fix)
7. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Verify ALL tests pass and build succeeds before PR completion

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Debug Webhook Test 500 Errors
- Investigate why webhook POST requests return 500 instead of 200
- Check if Svix.Webhook mock is properly configured
- Verify request body and headers are being processed correctly
- Ensure User model mocks are working as expected

### 2. Run Full Test Suite Analysis
- After webhook tests pass, run complete test suite
- Identify any other failing tests (likely Clerk-related ESM/import issues)
- Categorize failures by type for systematic resolution

### 3. Systematic Fix Remaining Issues
- Address each category of test failure methodically
- Apply same patterns used for webhook test fixes
- Ensure all mocks are compatible with Next.js 15.5.2 and current Clerk version

### 4. Final Validation
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure `npm run test:ci` returns 0 exit code (ALL tests pass)
- Verify `npm run build` succeeds 
- Run `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run type-check`
- Confirm CI checks pass in PR

## Test Infrastructure Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Created centralized header mocking functions: `setupMockHeaders()`, `setupMockHeadersWithNullValues()`, `setupMockHeadersWithError()`
- ‚úÖ Updated all webhook tests to use consolidated helpers
- ‚úÖ Fixed async headers() compatibility for Next.js 15.5.2
- ‚úÖ Added missing imports (NextRequest, Webhook) to test files
- ‚úÖ Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

## Context from Previous Work
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure issues resolved in previous PRs (jest config, auth imports, ESM modules)
- ‚úÖ Build system now functional with Next.js 15.5.2 and Clerk
- ‚úÖ Critical sub-issues #679 (auth imports) and #680 (Jest ESM config) completed
- üîÑ Final phase: ensuring ALL individual tests pass

## Files Recently Modified
1. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Fixed headers() await issue
2. ‚úÖ `next.config.js` - Updated typedRoutes configuration
3. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/webhook-test-utils.ts` - Added consolidated mocking helpers
4. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Updated to use new helpers

## Success Criteria (ALL REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds: `npm run build` passes
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: All tests pass: `npm run test:ci` returns 0 exit code
- ‚è≥ ESLint passes: `npm run lint:fix` 
- ‚è≥ TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
- ‚è≥ PR CI checks all green
- ‚è≥ Issue #678 can be closed as resolved

## Current Focus
**Debugging webhook test 500 errors to achieve 100% test pass rate - this is the final blocker before issue completion.**
