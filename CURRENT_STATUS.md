# Current Status - Issue #678 Remaining Test Failures Fix

## Current State
- **Branch**: `feature/issue-678-fix-remaining-test-failures`
- **Working Directory**: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- **Last Action**: Running test suite to identify all failing tests after infrastructure fixes were merged

## Goal
Complete resolution of Issue #678 "Multiple Test Suites Failing After Clerk Migration" by fixing all remaining individual test failures after the core infrastructure was successfully resolved in the previous PR.

## Critical Blocking Issues Identified

### 1. Build Failure (CRITICAL - BLOCKING)
**Error**: `./src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts:36:33 - Property 'get' does not exist on type 'Promise<ReadonlyHeaders>'`

**Root Cause**: In Next.js 15.5.2, `headers()` returns `Promise<ReadonlyHeaders>` but the code is calling `.get()` directly without awaiting.

**Fix**: Need to await the headers() call:
```typescript
// Current (broken):
const headersList = headers();
const svix_id = headersList.get('svix-id');

// Should be:
const headersList = await headers();
const svix_id = headersList.get('svix-id');
```

### 2. Next.js Config Warning
**Warning**: `experimental.typedRoutes` has been moved to `typedRoutes`. Need to update next.config.js.

### 3. Test Failures (After build fix)
Primary failing test identified: `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/registration-integration.test.ts`
- Multiple tests failing due to "headers called outside request scope"
- Webhook test mocking issues need resolution

## Current Todo List Status

1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Run full test suite to identify all currently failing tests
2. üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Fix critical webpack headers() TypeScript issue in route.ts - headers() returns Promise<ReadonlyHeaders>
3. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Update Next.js config to fix typedRoutes experimental warning
4. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Categorize remaining failing tests by type after webhook fix
5. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Fix webhook test mocking issues (registration-integration.test.ts)
6. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Fix remaining auth import and mock issues in API route tests
7. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Fix component tests that may have Clerk-related failures
8. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Verify all tests pass and build succeeds before creating PR

## Process to Follow

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Fix Build Error** - Update webhook route to properly await headers()
2. **Fix Next.js Config** - Update typedRoutes configuration 
3. **Test Build** - Ensure build passes with fixes
4. **Run Tests** - Get full picture of remaining test failures
5. **Systematic Fix** - Address each category of test failures methodically
6. **Validate** - Ensure all tests pass and build succeeds
7. **Create PR** - Submit for review with comprehensive description

### Quality Standards
- All tests must pass (`npm run test:ci`)
- Build must succeed (`npm run build`) 
- ESLint must pass (`npm run lint:fix`)
- TypeScript compilation must succeed (`npm run type-check`)
- Follow TDD approach with systematic fixes

## Context from Previous Work
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure issues resolved in previous PR (jest config, auth imports, ESM modules)
- ‚úÖ Build system now functional with Next.js 15.5.2 and Clerk
- ‚úÖ Critical sub-issues #679 (auth imports) and #680 (Jest ESM config) completed
- üîÑ Now focusing on remaining individual test failures and build compatibility

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention
1. `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Fix headers() await issue
2. `next.config.js` - Update typedRoutes configuration
3. `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/registration-integration.test.ts` - Fix webhook test mocking

## Expected Outcome
Complete resolution of Issue #678 with:
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Build succeeding without errors
- ‚úÖ Full Clerk migration compatibility validated
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline unblocked for future development
