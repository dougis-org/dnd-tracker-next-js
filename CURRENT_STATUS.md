# Current Status - Post-Clerk Migration Test Failures

## Current State

- **Branch**: `feature/issue-678-remove-nextauth-imports`
- **Working Directory**: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- **PR**: <https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/pull/690> (ready for merge after epic completion)
- **Last Action**: Created epic issue #691 and sub-issues for remaining test failures

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS: DEVELOPMENT BLOCKED

**ALL DEVELOPMENT IS BLOCKED** until the remaining test failures are resolved.

### Test Status Summary

- **47 failing test suites** containing **146 failing individual tests**
- `npm run test:ci` exits with non-zero code
- CI/CD pipeline failing
- Cannot safely merge features or deploy

## Goal

Complete resolution of all remaining test failures after the Clerk migration by systematically
fixing each failing test suite. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: ALL tests must pass
(`npm run test:ci` returns 0 exit code).

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED Issues

1. **NextAuth to Clerk Migration**: Successfully migrated all auth patterns from NextAuth to Clerk
2. **Build Success**: `npm run build` passes without errors
3. **Jest ESM Resolution**: Fixed critical `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` blocking 100+ tests
4. **Module Mapping**: Implemented comprehensive Jest module mapping for Clerk packages
5. **Core Infrastructure**: Created shared Clerk test helpers and mocking utilities
6. **AppLayout Fix**: Resolved TypeScript build error with missing HeaderSection props

### üö® CRITICAL STATUS: Epic #691 - Remaining Test Failures

**Epic Issue**: [#691 - EPIC: Resolve Remaining Test Failures After Clerk Migration](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/691)

The remaining work is organized into focused sub-issues:

#### High-Priority Sub-Issues (Complete these first)

1. **[#692 - Fix ClerkSignUpPage.test.tsx](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/692)**
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Category**: ESM Import Resolution
   - **Problem**: Resolved ESM token errors and test logic.
   - **Impact**: Unblocked other auth page tests.
   - **Command**: `npm test -- --testPathPatterns="ClerkSignUpPage.test.tsx"`

2. **[#693 - Fix auth-architecture.test.tsx](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/693)**
   - **Category**: Component Integration
   - **Priority**: P1 - Critical
   - **Problem**: Authentication architecture validation failing
   - **Impact**: Core auth patterns not validated
   - **Command**: `npm test -- --testPathPatterns="auth-architecture.test.tsx"`

3. **[#694 - Fix parties page.auth.test.tsx](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/694)**
   - **Category**: Page Authentication Tests
   - **Priority**: P1 - Critical
   - **Problem**: Page-level auth integration broken
   - **Impact**: Protected routes not properly tested
   - **Command**: `npm test -- --testPathPatterns="parties.*auth.test.tsx"`

4. **[#695 - Fix API route authentication tests](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/695)**
   - **Category**: Server-side Authentication
   - **Priority**: P1 - Critical
   - **Problem**: API routes with Clerk server-side auth failing
   - **Impact**: Backend authentication not validated
   - **Command**: `npm test -- --testPathPatterns="api.*auth|middleware"`

#### Systematic Completion

1. **[#696 - Fix remaining 43 test suites](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/696)**
   - **Category**: Systematic Migration Completion
   - **Priority**: P1 - Critical
   - **Problem**: Various remaining auth-related test patterns
   - **Impact**: Long-tail issues blocking final completion
   - **Command**: `npm run test:ci`

## Work Order and Priority

### Phase 1: ESM and Core Infrastructure (Issues #692-693)

Focus on resolving the fundamental ESM import and architectural issues first, as these
may be blocking other tests.

### Phase 2: Integration Patterns (Issues #694-695) 
Fix the core integration patterns for pages and API routes, establishing consistent
patterns that other tests can follow.

### Phase 3: Systematic Completion (Issue #696)

Address the remaining test suites systematically, identifying common patterns and
resolving edge cases.

## Quality Gates

### Before ANY issue work

1. Verify current test status: `npm run test:ci 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Suites:|Tests:"`
2. Confirm build still works: `npm run build`
3. Check linting: `npm run lint:fix`

### After ANY issue completion

1. Verify specific tests pass: Use issue-specific test commands
2. Run full test suite to check for regressions: `npm run test:ci`
3. Commit and push changes immediately
4. Update issue status and close when complete

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: `npm run test:ci` returns exit code 0
- **Secondary**: All 47 failing test suites resolved
- **Tertiary**: All 146 failing individual tests passing
- **Final**: CI/CD pipeline green, development unblocked

## Files Recently Modified

1. ‚úÖ `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` (HeaderSection props fix)
2. ‚úÖ `jest.config.js` (Clerk module mapping)
3. ‚úÖ `src/lib/test-utils/shared-clerk-test-helpers.tsx` (comprehensive Clerk mocks)
4. ‚úÖ Various test files (NextAuth to Clerk migration)

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Blocks ALL Development Work

- Feature development
- Bug fixes (except test-related)
- Refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Any new pull requests

### Must Complete Before Merge

- Epic #691 and all sub-issues resolved
- Full test suite passing
- CI checks green

## Current Focus

**Systematic resolution of all remaining test failures through the epic/sub-issue structure,
working in priority order to unblock development as quickly as possible.**

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMINDER**: No other development work should proceed until this epic is completed and
the test suite is fully green.
