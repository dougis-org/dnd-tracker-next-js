### **Priority Distribution:**

- **P1 Issues:** 37 issues (80%) - Critical for MVP
- **P2 Issues:** 9 issues (20%) - Important enhancements

### **Dependency Flow:**

- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundation (no dependencies)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Build on foundation

4. **Encounter System (Weeks 7-8):** Required for combat
5. **Combat Foundation (Week 9):** Required for advanced combat

### **Parallel Development Opportunities:**

- **UI Components** can be developed alongside data models
- **Testing** can be written as features are completed
- **Documentation** can be updated continuously

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

### **Weekly Sprint Structure:**

1. **Monday:** Sprint planning and issue assignment
2. **Tuesday-Thursday:** Development work
3. **Friday:** Testing, code review, and sprint completion
4. **Weekend:** Documentation and preparation for next week

### **Quality Gates:**

- **End of Week 2:** Basic project structure and tools
- **End of Week 4:** User authentication working
- **End of Week 6:** Character management complete
- **End of Week 8:** Encounter management complete
- **End of Week 10:** Basic combat system functional
- **End of Week 12:** Production-ready MVP

### **Risk Mitigation:**

- **20% time buffer** built into Week 12
- **Critical dependencies** identified and front-loaded
- **Parallel workstreams** where possible
- **Regular testing** throughout development

---

## üìã **NEXT ACTIONS**

### **For GitHub Issues Update:**

Each issue should be updated with:

```
Phase: Week X - [Theme]
Priority: P1/P2
Dependencies: [Issue numbers]
Week Focus: [Brief description]
```

### **For Project Management:**

1. **Create GitHub Project Board** with 12 weekly columns
2. **Assign issues to appropriate weeks**
3. **Set up Sprint automation** for weekly planning
4. **Configure progress tracking** and burndown charts

**This 12-week plan provides a systematic approach to MVP development with clear
milestones, dependencies, and deliverables for each week.**
