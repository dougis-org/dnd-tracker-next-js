# Fly.io Authentication Configuration

## Summary

This document records the authentication environment configuration set up
for production deployment on Fly.io as part of Issue #529.

## Environment Variables Configured

The following environment variables have been set in the Fly.io production
environment via `flyctl secrets set`:

### NextAuth Configuration

- `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://dnd-tracker-next-js.fly.dev` - Production URL for
  NextAuth
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generated-32-char-secret]` - Secure secret for JWT signing
- `NEXTAUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=dnd-tracker-next-js.fly.dev` - Cookie domain for
  sessions
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` - Required for NextAuth v5 in production

### Database Configuration

- `MONGODB_URI=[connection-string]` - MongoDB Atlas connection (already
  configured)
- `MONGODB_DB_NAME=[database-name]` - Production database name (already
  configured)

### Additional Configuration

- `NODE_ENV=production` - Environment setting (already configured)
- `SESSION_SECRET=[generated-secret]` - Session encryption secret (already
  configured)
- `TRUSTED_ORIGINS=[origins]` - Trusted origins for CORS (already configured)
- `APP_URL=https://dnd-tracker-next-js.fly.dev` - Application URL (already
  configured)

## Authentication Endpoints Verified

All authentication endpoints are working correctly in production:

- ✅ `/api/health` - Returns 200 with database connection status
- ✅ `/api/auth/signin` - Returns 302 redirect (correct behavior)
- ✅ `/api/auth/session` - Returns 200 with null (no active session)
- ✅ `/api/auth/csrf` - Returns 200 with valid CSRF token
- ✅ `/api/auth/providers` - Returns 200 with credentials provider configuration

## Authentication Configuration

The application uses NextAuth v5 with:

- **Strategy**: JWT sessions with MongoDB adapter
- **Providers**: Credentials provider for email/password authentication
- **Session Duration**: 30 days with 24-hour update interval
- **Trusted Domains**:
  - dnd-tracker-next-js.fly.dev (primary)
  - dnd-tracker.fly.dev
  - dndtracker.com
  - <www.dndtracker.com>

## Security Features

- HTTPS enforced via Fly.io configuration
- Secure JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Session validation with token expiration checks
- Redirect protection to prevent malicious redirects
- Production hostname validation

## Testing Results

- Production environment is running successfully
- Authentication endpoints are accessible and responding correctly
- MongoDB connection is established and healthy
- Session storage is properly configured with JWT strategy

## Configuration Files Updated

No code changes were required as the NextAuth configuration in
`src/lib/auth.ts` already supported all the required production environment
variables and security features.

## Issue Status

✅ **Issue #529 - Phase 3.1: Configure Fly.io environment for authentication**
- COMPLETED

All success criteria met:

- ✅ All required environment variables set in Fly.io
