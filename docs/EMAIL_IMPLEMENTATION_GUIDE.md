# Email Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing email functionality in the D&D Tracker application. The project currently has complete email-related authentication flows but lacks the actual email sending capability.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What Already Exists
- **Database Schema**: Complete User model with email verification and password reset token fields
- **Service Layer**: Full UserServiceAuth implementation with all email-related methods
- **API Routes**: All authentication endpoints implemented
- **Frontend Components**: Complete UI for email verification, password reset, and registration
- **Configuration**: Environment variables defined for email service integration

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Email Service Integration**: No actual email sending capability
- **Email Templates**: No HTML/text email templates
- **Email Queue System**: No reliable email delivery mechanism
- **Email Testing Tools**: No development email testing setup
- **Security Features**: No email content sanitization or compliance features

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Email Service Setup** (Issue #424)
   - Install email service packages (@sendgrid/mail or nodemailer)
   - Configure SMTP settings and API keys
   - Implement email sending service class
   - Update UserServiceAuth to call email service

2. **Email Templates** (Issue #425)
   - Create HTML and text email templates
   - Implement template rendering system
   - Add branding and styling
   - Create templates for: verification, password reset, welcome emails

### Phase 2: Security and Testing (Week 2)
3. **Security Features** (Issue #428)
   - Implement email content sanitization
   - Add rate limiting for email sending
   - Configure GDPR compliance features
   - Set up email delivery monitoring

4. **Testing Strategy** (Issue #426)
   - Set up MailHog for local development
   - Create email service mocks for unit tests
   - Implement email template testing
   - Add integration tests for email flows

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 3)
5. **Email Queue System** (Issue #427)
   - Implement Redis-based email queue
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed emails
   - Set up email delivery monitoring
   - Configure production email service

## Technical Implementation Details

### Email Service Integration Points

The following methods in `UserServiceAuth.ts` need to be updated to send emails:

1. **createUser()** (line 36-57)
   - Currently generates email verification token
   - Needs to send welcome + verification email

2. **requestPasswordReset()** (line 308-337)
   - Currently generates reset token
   - Needs to send password reset email

3. **resendVerificationEmail()** (line 434-456)
   - Currently generates verification token
   - Needs to send verification email

### Email Templates Required

1. **Welcome Email** - Sent after user registration
2. **Email Verification** - Sent to verify email address
3. **Password Reset** - Sent when user requests password reset
4. **Password Changed** - Sent when password is successfully changed

### Configuration Variables

Production environment variables (already defined in `.env.production.example`):
```env
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=apikey
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@dndtracker.com
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Development Testing
- Use MailHog for local email testing
- Mock email service in unit tests
- Test email template rendering
- Validate email content and formatting

#### Integration Testing
- Test complete email flows (registration, verification, password reset)
- Verify email delivery and content
- Test error handling and retry mechanisms
- Validate email queue functionality

#### Production Testing
- Use SendGrid's test mode for staging
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Test email deliverability
- Verify compliance with email regulations

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Required Packages
- `@sendgrid/mail` - SendGrid integration
- `handlebars` - Email template rendering
- `bull` - Redis-based job queue
- `ioredis` - Redis client for queue system

### External Services
- SendGrid account and API key
- Redis instance for email queue
- Email domain verification (SPF, DKIM)

### Development Tools
- MailHog for local email testing
- Email template preview tools
- Email deliverability testing tools
