#### Future Epic Tasks

#### Issue #658 - Update UI Components for Clerk

- Update user profile components
- Ensure consistent Clerk theming

#### ‚úÖ Issue #655 - Remove NextAuth Code (COMPLETED - PR #674)

**Summary**: Systematically removed all NextAuth code and dependencies from the codebase,
completing the Clerk migration cleanup.

**Files Removed**:

- `src/__mocks__/next-auth.js` - NextAuth mock file
- `src/__mocks__/@auth/` - Auth mock directory structure
- `src/lib/auth/auth-callbacks.ts` - NextAuth callback functions
- `src/lib/auth/` - Entire auth directory

**Code Updates**:

- Renamed `setupNextAuthMocks` to `setupClerkMocks` in test utilities
- Updated session constants to use Clerk cookie naming patterns
- Fixed cookie manipulation tests to use `clerk-session` instead of `next-auth.session-token`
- Updated documentation references from NextAuth to Clerk
- Cleaned up `.env.local` and `.env.example` NextAuth variables

**New Test Infrastructure**:

- `src/__tests__/nextauth-cleanup-verification.test.ts` - Comprehensive cleanup verification
  - Validates complete package dependency removal
  - Scans all source files for remaining NextAuth patterns
  - Verifies environment configuration cleanup
  - Ensures middleware uses Clerk instead of NextAuth

**Verification Results**:

- ‚úÖ All NextAuth cleanup verification tests pass
- ‚úÖ No NextAuth dependencies in package.json
- ‚úÖ No NextAuth code references remain in codebase
- ‚úÖ Environment files updated for Clerk-only patterns
- ‚úÖ ESLint compliance maintained

#### Issue #656 - Clean Up Environment Variables

- Remove NextAuth environment variables
- Update documentation
- Clean up .env.example file

#### Issue #657 - Migrate Tests to Clerk

- Update authentication tests
- Mock Clerk in test environment
- Ensure test coverage for Clerk flows

### Technical Implementation Notes

- `src/lib/middleware.ts` - Authentication utilities with Clerk
- `src/lib/api/session-route-helpers.ts` - Session helpers using Clerk auth()
- `src/lib/clerk-config.ts` - Clerk configuration and route definitions

- `src/lib/services/UserService.ts` - Enhanced with Clerk integration operations
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Webhook handlers for user synchronization

#### New Test Infrastructure

- `src/lib/models/__tests__/User.registration.test.ts` - User model registration tests
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/UserServiceRegistration.test.ts` - Service integration tests
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/registration-integration.test.ts` - Webhook integration tests

#### Clerk Patterns Established

```typescript
// Middleware pattern
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const session = await auth();
  // Route protection logic
});

// Session utilities
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
const { userId } = await auth();
```

#### Current Architecture

- Next.js 15 App Router with Clerk middleware
- Clerk SignIn/SignUp components replacing NextAuth pages
- MongoDB Users collection with Clerk integration
- Comprehensive webhook system for user data synchronization
- Enhanced error logging throughout auth flow
- Route protection for both pages and API endpoints
- Complete user profile creation and subscription management

### Epic Progress Summary

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Core Registration Flow Complete** ‚úÖ

The fundamental Clerk integration is now operational:

- ‚úÖ **Authentication Infrastructure**: Middleware and route protection implemented
- ‚úÖ **User Registration**: Complete flow from Clerk signup to MongoDB user creation
- ‚úÖ **UI Components**: Clerk components integrated into existing app structure
- ‚úÖ **Data Synchronization**: Webhook-based user data sync established
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test infrastructure for registration flows

### Immediate Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Issue #655** - Complete removal of NextAuth code (COMPLETED - PR #674).
2. **Validate webhook system** - Ensure all Clerk events are properly handled
3. **UI/UX polish** - Ensure consistent user experience across auth flows
4. **Performance optimization** - Review and optimize authentication middleware performance

### Dependencies and Blockers

- ‚úÖ All Clerk dependencies installed and configured
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection established and working
- ‚úÖ Webhook system operational
- üü° **Minor**: Additional webhook event validation may be needed
- üü¢ **Ready for next phase**: Login/logout flow implementation

### üö® CURRENT HIGH PRIORITY: Issue #675 - Clerk Public Key Configuration for Build Process

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Clerk public key configuration is now centralized and validated at build time.
Build process is unblocked.

**Resolution**: Clerk public key is now managed in `src/lib/config/clerk.ts` as a constant with a fallback value.
The configuration is validated at build time, ensuring the key is always available for static generation and deployment.
This resolves the previous build blocker.

**Key Implementation:**
- Centralized `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` constant with environment variable and fallback
- Build-time validation with clear error messages
- Safe client exposure and server-only secret key handling
- Documented in `src/lib/config/clerk.ts` and this file

**GitHub Issue**: [#675](https://github.com/dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js/issues/675) (RESOLVED)

#### Future Epic Tasks

#### Issue #656 - Clean Up Environment Variables

- Remove NextAuth environment variables
- Update documentation
- Clean up .env.example file

## Notes for Resumption

- Working directory: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
