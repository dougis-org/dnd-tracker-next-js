- Set up Clerk configuration files
- Environment variables configured
- Status: **MERGED**

### Current Task: Issue #653 - User Registration Flow with Clerk

**Branch:** `feature/issue-653-user-registration-flow`
**Status:** In Progress - **REQUIRES SUB-ISSUE BREAKDOWN**

#### ⚠️ Recommended Action: Break Down Issue #653

The Issue #653 scope is too large for a single implementation and should be broken into smaller sub-issues for better manageability:

**Proposed Sub-Issues:**

1. **Issue #653-1: Replace SignIn/SignUp Pages**
   - Convert existing auth pages to use Clerk components (`<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`)
   - Update routing and page structure
   - Remove NextAuth signin/signup page logic

2. **Issue #653-2: User Data Synchronization Setup**
   - Implement Clerk webhook handlers for user events
   - Set up user data sync between Clerk and MongoDB Users collection
   - Handle user creation, updates, and deletion events

3. **Issue #653-3: Registration Flow Integration**
   - Integrate Clerk user creation with application user profiles
   - Set up initial user data structure in MongoDB
   - Handle subscription tier assignments

4. **Issue #653-4: Registration Flow Testing**
   - Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for registration
   - Test user data synchronization
   - Validate complete user creation workflow

#### Current Todo List
- [x] Create branch for Issue #653
- [ ] Analyze current signin page and registration components
- [ ] Implement Clerk SignUp component integration  
- [ ] Set up user data sync with MongoDB Users collection
- [ ] Test complete registration and user creation flow

### Remaining Epic Tasks

#### Issue #654 - User Login/Logout Flows
- Replace login/logout functionality with Clerk
- Update session management

#### Issue #658 - Update UI Components for Clerk  
- Convert auth-related UI components
- Update user profile components

#### Issue #655 - Remove NextAuth Code
- Clean up remaining NextAuth dependencies
- Remove unused auth files

#### Issue #656 - Clean Up Environment Variables
- Remove NextAuth environment variables
- Update documentation

#### Issue #657 - Migrate Tests to Clerk
- Update authentication tests
- Mock Clerk in test environment

### Technical Implementation Notes

#### Key Files Modified
- `src/middleware.ts` - Main middleware using clerkMiddleware()
- `src/lib/middleware.ts` - Authentication utilities with Clerk
- `src/lib/api/session-route-helpers.ts` - Session helpers using Clerk auth()
- `src/lib/clerk-config.ts` - Clerk configuration and route definitions

#### Clerk Patterns Established
```typescript
// Middleware pattern
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const session = await auth();
  // Route protection logic
});

// Session utilities
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
const { userId } = await auth();
```

#### Current Architecture
- Next.js 15 App Router with Clerk middleware
- MongoDB Users collection for extended user data
- Enhanced error logging throughout auth flow
- Route protection for both pages and API endpoints

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create sub-issues for Issue #653** as outlined above for better project management
2. **Analyze existing auth components** in `src/app/(auth)/` directory
3. **Review current user registration flow** and identify Clerk integration points
4. **Start with Issue #653-1** (Replace SignIn/SignUp Pages) as the foundational change

### Dependencies and Blockers

- No current technical blockers
- Issue #653 scope may require breakdown into sub-issues for manageable development
- All Clerk dependencies installed and configured
- MongoDB connection established for user data sync

## Notes for Resumption

- Working directory: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- Current branch: `feature/issue-653-user-registration-flow`
- Repository: `dougis-org/dnd-tracker`
- Epic: NextAuth to Clerk Migration (#650)
- Quality checks required: ESLint, TypeScript, Codacy scan after each change
- Follow TDD approach with comprehensive testing
