### Technical Implementation Notes

#### Key Files Modified
- `src/middleware.ts` - Main middleware using clerkMiddleware()
- `src/lib/middleware.ts` - Authentication utilities with Clerk
- `src/lib/api/session-route-helpers.ts` - Session helpers using Clerk auth()
- `src/lib/clerk-config.ts` - Clerk configuration and route definitions
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Clerk SignIn component integration
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` - Clerk SignUp component integration
- `src/lib/services/UserService.ts` - Enhanced with Clerk integration operations
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Webhook handlers for user synchronization

#### New Test Infrastructure
- `src/lib/models/__tests__/User.registration.test.ts` - User model registration tests
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/UserServiceRegistration.test.ts` - Service integration tests
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/registration-integration.test.ts` - Webhook integration tests
- `src/test-utils/user-registration-mocks.ts` - Shared test utilities for registration flows

#### Clerk Patterns Established
```typescript
// Middleware pattern
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const session = await auth();
  // Route protection logic
});

// Session utilities
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
const { userId } = await auth();
```

#### Current Architecture
- Next.js 15 App Router with Clerk middleware
- Clerk SignIn/SignUp components replacing NextAuth pages
- MongoDB Users collection with Clerk integration
- Comprehensive webhook system for user data synchronization
- Enhanced error logging throughout auth flow
- Route protection for both pages and API endpoints
- Complete user profile creation and subscription management

### Epic Progress Summary

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Core Registration Flow Complete** ✅

The fundamental Clerk integration is now operational:
- ✅ **Authentication Infrastructure**: Middleware and route protection implemented
- ✅ **User Registration**: Complete flow from Clerk signup to MongoDB user creation
- ✅ **UI Components**: Clerk components integrated into existing app structure
- ✅ **Data Synchronization**: Webhook-based user data sync established
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test infrastructure for registration flows

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Issue #654** - Focus on user login/logout flows to complete the authentication cycle
2. **Validate webhook system** - Ensure all Clerk events are properly handled
3. **UI/UX polish** - Ensure consistent user experience across auth flows
4. **Performance optimization** - Review and optimize authentication middleware performance

### Dependencies and Blockers

- ✅ All Clerk dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ MongoDB connection established and working
- ✅ Webhook system operational
- 🟡 **Minor**: Additional webhook event validation may be needed
- 🟢 **Ready for next phase**: Login/logout flow implementation

## Notes for Resumption

- Working directory: `/home/doug/ai-dev-1/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- Current branch: `main` (registration work complete)
- Repository: `dougis-org/dnd-tracker-next-js`
- Epic: NextAuth to Clerk Migration (#650) - ~60% complete
- Next priority: Issue #654 - User Login/Logout Flows
- Quality checks required: ESLint, TypeScript, Codacy scan after each change
- Continue TDD approach with comprehensive testing
